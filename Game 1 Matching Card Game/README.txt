This is my first Unity game.

This is a matching card game on a 4x4 grid.
Assets are from unity asset store/internet.

Game Features:
- Bad matches take ~1s to flip back.
- Score is based on time remaining.

Game Problems:
- Sometimes if you fast click the cards they will not flip on their front face, so you must click them again.
- The random function is not well implemented / has a bad distribution
as a result, cards are sometimes arranged in a predictable manner.
