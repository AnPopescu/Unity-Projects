# Unity-Projects

I started working with Unity as a requirement following my masters Degree on Graphics Multimedia and VR.
Since then I have created a couple of projects, most of them just to get familiar with the Unity Engine and to pass my classes.
Most of the projects are made while following online tutorials and and not entirely designed by me.
